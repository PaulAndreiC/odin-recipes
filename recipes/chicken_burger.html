            <li>
                2 tablespoons chopped <strong>cilantro</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, minced
            </li>
            <li>
                5 <strong>chipotle peppers</strong> in adobo sauce, minced
            </li>
            <li>
                1 <strong>mango</strong> - peeled, seeded, and chopped
            </li>
            <li>
                4 <strong>hamburger buns</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                4 slices <strong>gouda cheese</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                4 tablespoons <strong>mayonnaise</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup shredded <strong>lettuce</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine ground chicken, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, egg, lime zest, cilantro, garlic, and chipotle in a bowl. Shape mixture into four 1/4-pound patties.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, stir together chopped mangoes and the juice of the lime in a small bowl; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grill chicken burgers on the preheated grill until chicken is no longer pink inside, juices run clear, and burgers show browned grill marks, 5 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                About 2 minutes before burgers are done, place hamburger buns onto the grill to toast, about 1 minute per side. About 1 minute before the burgers are done, top each burger with a slice of Gouda cheese, and let melt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread each bun with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise and top with 1/4 cup shredded lettuce and grilled chicken burger. Spoon 1/4 of mango-lime mixture on each burger and top with the other half of the bun to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
